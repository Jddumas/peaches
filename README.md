# Introduction

Project Peaches is a all-in-one grocery & retail inventory management system. It provides the solution for ship-to-customer grocery sales.

### Technology

- Backend: Flask Python
  - Database: Postgres 12
  - Schema migrator: Flyway
  - Db Admin: pgAdmin
  - API & communication: RESTful APIs.
- Front-end: React 18
- Containerization: Docker compose

# Getting started

This guide assumes you have the following dependencies already set up:

- Docker
- Python 3.9.0

If you haven't got those ready, please refer to their documentations online.

## Backend

Run:

```sh
    $ docker-compose up
```

This will starts (and install/build) the backend server, database, schema migrator, and üõéÔ∏èüìØ.

If you install new python dependencies, or otherwise change the build process, run

```sh
docker-compose build
```

so that the backend can be rebuilt.

**Test**

_To be updated_

Pytest is a python testing framework. Any python file containing the word `test_` will be run. Refer to Pytest documentation to learn how to write tests.

## Source control workflow

### Create a new branch

```sh
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

Where `<branch_name>` is a string without space. It is recomended to name your branch with a descriptive name, like `feature_add_new_route`, for instance.

### Stage the changes

After you've done with your changes, it's time to stage them for subsequent committing.

```sh
$ git add <path_to_modified_files>
```

Where `<path_to_modified_files>` is the path to files of change. If the path refer to a directory instead of a file, all changed files within that directory will be staged.

To unstage, run `git reset <path_to_modified_files>`. Same rule applies.

### Commit the changes

After you've staged your desired change, create a commit.

```
$ git commit -m "<your message>".
```

Give it a descriptive message.

### Push to origin

When you are ready to have your code reviewed by other people, run:

```sh
git push <branch_to_be_pushed>
```

A pop up will appear from github server. Follow the link to create a pull request.

### Update main

After your changes has been approved and merged to main, your `main` will become outdated. It is therefore necessary to sync with Github (aka upstream).

```
$ git checkout main
$ git pull origin
```

And that's how you ace the git workflow ;).
